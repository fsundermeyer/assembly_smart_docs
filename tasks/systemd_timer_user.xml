  <title>Using &systemd; timers as a regular user</title>
  <info>
    <abstract>
      <para>
        &systemd; timers can also be used by regular users to, for example, automate reoccurring
        tasks.
      </para>
    </abstract>
  </info>
  <para>
    Similar to cron, you can also use &systemd; timers as a regular users. It will help you to
    automate reoccuring tasks like regular backups, processing images, or moving data to the
    cloud. The same procedures and tasks as mentioned above are valid, however the following
    differences apply:
  </para>
  <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
      <para>
        Timer and service files need to be placed in <filename>~/.config/systemd/user/</filename>.
      </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>
        All <command>systemctl</command> and <command>journalctl</command> command need to be run
        with the <option>--user</option> switch. Note that <command>systemd-analyze</command> does
        <emphasis>not</emphasis> support this option.
      </para>
      <screen>&prompt.user;systemctl --user start ~/.config/systemd/user/helloworld.timer
&prompt.user;systemctl --user enable ~/.config/systemd/user/helloworld.timer
&prompt.user;systemctl --user list-timers
&prompt.user;journalctl --user -u helloworld.*
&prompt.user;systemctl-analyze ~/.config/systemd/user/helloworld.timer</screen>
      <note>
        <title>Provide the path for the unit files</title>
        <para>
          As a regular user, you should provide the path to the unit files as in the examples
          above, to avoid confusion with system unit files with the same name.
        </para>

  <important>
    <title>User timers only run during an active session</title>
    <para>
      As with other systemd services started as a regular user, user timers only run when the user
      is logged in. In case you want to start user timers at boot time and continue them after log
      out, enable lingering for each affected user:
    </para>
    <screen>sudo loginctl enable-linger <replaceable>USER</replaceable></screen>
    <para>
      For more information refer to <command>man 1 loginctl</command>.
    </para>
  </important>
  <important>
    <title>Environment variables are not inherited</title>
    <para>
      The &systemd; user instance does not inherit environment variables set by scripts like
      <filename>~/.profile</filename> or <filename>~/.bashrc</filename>. To check the systemd
      environment run <command>systemctl --user show-environment</command>.
    </para>
    <para>
      To import any variables missing in the &systemd; environment, specify the following command
      at the end of you <filename>~/.bashrc</filename>:
    </para>
    <screen>systemctl --user import-environment <replaceable>VARIABLE1</replaceable> <replaceable>VARIABLE2</replaceable></screen>
  </important>
