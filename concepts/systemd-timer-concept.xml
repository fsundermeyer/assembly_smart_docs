   Similar to cron, systemd timer units provide a mechanism for scheduling jobs
   on Linux. Although systemd timer units serve the same purpose as cron, they
   offer several advantages.

    <para>
     Jobs scheduled using a timer unit can depend on other &systemd;
     services. Timer units are treated as regular &systemd; services, so can be
     managed with <command>systemctl</command>.

     Timers can be realtime (being triggered on calendar events) and monotonic
     being triggered at a specified time elapsed from a certain starting point.

     Time units are logged to the system journal, which makes it easier to
     monitor and troubleshoot them.

     Uses the centralized &systemd; management services.

     If the system is off during the expected execution time, the timer is
     executed once the system is running again.

  <para>
   &systemd; timer units are identified by the <filename
   class="extension">.timer</filename> file name extension. Each timer file
   requires a corresponding service file it controls. In other words, a timer
   file activates and manages the corresponding service file. For a full
   refernce on systemd timers including advanced configuration options (like
   delays or handling clock or time zone changes) refer to <command>man 5
   systemd.timer</command>.
